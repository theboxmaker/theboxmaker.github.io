                <p><b>Personal Background:</b> Born and raised in Charlotte, NC. I like rock climbing and golf. I look
                    forward to

                <p><b>Background in this subject:</b> My background in this subject was fairly limited coming into the
                    program. I completed
                    a UX/UI certificate through Google on my own time and that is what led me to web development. That
                    certificate did not
                    include any coding but covered brainstorming, prototyping, user research, and good design practices.
