<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>
    I, <a href="index.php?page=introduction">Zachary J. Tucker</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my
    Fall 2025 WEB250-N801 Database Driven Websites course with my instructor, D. I. von Briesen.
</p>

<p>
    I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.
    I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private.

<p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
    As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
