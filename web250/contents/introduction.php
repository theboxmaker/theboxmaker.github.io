    <li>
        <p><b>Personal Background:</b> I am 26 years old, born and raised in Charlotte! I spend all of my time
            either with my fiancée, golfing, rock climbing, or for one last semester, doing homework.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><b>Professional Background:</b> I worked at a few places for small periods of time, but my main
            source of income has been working as a delivery driver for almost the last 8 years.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><b>Academic Background:</b> I graduated high school in 2017 as a part of our school's pilot
            engineering program. I attended UNCC for a year for architecture and was unmotivated at the time,
            so I left. After time away, I took graphic design classes at CPCC, decided that wasn’t for me,
            and now I’m here in the Full Stack Programming degree—learning a lot and having fun!</p>

    <li>
        <p><b>Background in this subject:</b> My background was fairly limited before entering this program.
            I completed a UX/UI certificate through Google, which involved brainstorming, prototyping,
            user research, and good design practices—no coding, but it led me to web development.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> I do all of my work from my Lenovo Yoga 7 running Windows 11.</p>
    </li>
