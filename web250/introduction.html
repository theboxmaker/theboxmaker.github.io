            <li>
                <strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am 26 years old, born and raised in Charlotte! I spend all of my
                time
                either
                with my fianc√©e, golfing, rock climbing, or for one last semester, doing homework.
            </li>

                <strong>Professional Background:</strong> I worked at a few places for small periods of time, but my
                main
                source of
                income
                has been working as a delivery driver for almost the last 8 years.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated high school in 2017 as a part of our school's pilot
                engineering
                program.
                I attended UNCC for a year for architecture and was unmotivated to do anything at that time, so I
                left.
                After some time away
                I took some graphic design classes at CPCC, and decided that wasn't for me either. Now I'm here in
                the
                Full Stack Programming
                degree and I'm learning a lot and having fun!
            </li>

                <strong>Background in this subject:</strong> My background in this subject was fairly limited coming
                into the
                program. I completed
                a UX/UI certificate through Google on my own time and that is what led me to web development. That
                certificate did not
                include any coding but covered brainstorming, prototyping, user research, and good design practices.

                <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I do all of my work from my Lenovo Yoga 7, running Windows
                11.

                        would
                        like to be in a management position in the future, and enjoyed being the SCRUM Master in my
                        software
                        development
                        class last semester.</li>

                    <li><strong>WEB140 - Web Development Tools:</strong> I am taking this class to learn about the tools
                        needed to

                    <li><strong><a href="index.html">WEB250</a> - Database Driven Websites:</strong> I am taking this
                        class to learn more about databases
                        and
                        how they
                        can be used in conjunction with websites. I previously took a database class and enjoyed it!

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By:</strong> I've had about 3 golf clubs fly out of my
                hands due
                to
                the rain, and one of
                them ended up in a tree.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I've partially torn the A2 pulley in both of my ring fingers as
                a
                result
                of rock climbing.
                The recovery takes forever!
