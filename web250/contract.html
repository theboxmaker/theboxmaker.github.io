            Websites with my instructor, D. I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        <p>I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I
            will not put
            information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private
        </p>
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
            failure to
            turn in assignments may show as absences
        </p>
