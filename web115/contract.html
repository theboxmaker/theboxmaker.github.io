    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Zachary J. Tucker</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2025 WEB115-N850 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor,
        Aastha Saxena.
    </p>
    <p>I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put 
        information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private
    </p>
    <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to 
        turn in assignments may show as absences
    </p>
    <p>Signed: <i>Zachary J. Tucker, 21 August 2025</i></p>
