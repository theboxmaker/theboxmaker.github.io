    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>Personal Background:</b> I am 26 years old, born and raised in Charlotte! I spend all of my time either 
        with my fianc√©e, golfing, rock climbing, or for one last semester, doing homework.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Professional Background:</b> I worked at a few places for small periods of time, but my main source of income 
        has been working as a delivery driver for almost the last 8 years.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Academic Background:</b> I graduated high school in 2017 as a part of our school's pilot engineering program. 
        I attended UNCC for a year for architecture and was unmotivated to do anything at that time, so I left. After some time away 
        I took some graphic design classes at CPCC, and decided that wasn't for me either. Now I'm here in the Full Stack Programming 
        degree and I'm learning a lot and having fun!</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Background in this subject:</b> My background in this subject was fairly limited coming into the program. I completed
        a UX/UI certificate through Google on my own time and that is what led me to web development. That certificate did not 
        include any coding but covered brainstorming, prototyping, user research, and good design practices.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> I do all of my work from my Lenovo Yoga 7, running Windows 11.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Courses I'm Taking and Why:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>CSC221 - Advanced Python Programming:</b> I am taking this class to build on the skills I gained in 
                the basic Python programming class.</li>
                <li><b>CTS240 - Project Management:</b> I am taking this course to learn about project management. I would 
                like to be in a management position in the future, and enjoyed being the SCRUM Master in my software development 
                class last semester.</li>
                <li><b><a href="web115/">WEB115</a> - Web Markup and Scripting:</b> I am taking this class to further develop my web development skills.</li>
                <li><b>WEB140 - Web Development Tools:</b> I am taking this class to learn about the tools needed to build websites.</li>
                <li><b>WEB215 - Advanced Markup and Scripting:</b> I am taking this class to build upon the skills developed in WEB115.</li>
                <li><b>WEB250 - Database Driven Websites:</b> I  am taking this class to learn more about databases and how they 
                can be used in conjunction with websites. I previously took a database class and enjoyed it!</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By:</b> I've had about 3 golf clubs fly out of my hands due to the rain, and one of 
        them ended up in a tree.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>I'd also like to share:</b> I've partially torn the A2 pulley in both of my ring fingers as a result of rock climbing. 
        The recovery takes forever!</p></li>
    </ul>
